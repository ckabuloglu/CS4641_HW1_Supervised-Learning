For this homework, I've written seperate python (python 2.7) scripts for each dataset and certain algorithm.

Running the scrits will produce the graphs I have acquired before since all of the use the same random state. However, I used WEKA for the decision tree part on the letter recognition dataset. I simply uploaded the dataset csv file into WEKA and ran the decision tree algorithm J48 with different confidence levels. These values can be seen on the graph. 

To run the rest of the python scripts, the dependencies listed below needs to be 'pip install''ed and ran with the python command through terminal. Running the scripts will be simple reproduce the graphs which can be found in the figures folder.

Dependencies:
    - Matplotlib
    - Scipy
    - sklearn
    - numpy
    - seaborn
    - plot
